        <h2>Akota Bridge: Night breezes and dancing lights</h2>
        <p>
          Did you perhaps click on the picture because of how vibrant it looked? If you did, I relate to you. Tucked between two of the busiest roads in Vadodara, bustling with behicles and people, mapped out with numerous traffic signals at every juncture, this
          bridge serves as the perfect connecting transit between them. No matter which season you choose to go in, there are always cool and refreshing winds blowing here. I remember my voyages to the bridge every week with my family. We would, at first, just go up on the bridge and admire the peaceful view (this was when there were no lights installed at the bridge),
          and go down the same way, before moving on ahead, letting the breeze in through the open windows. However, it was at my mother's suggestion, that one day, we decided to stop the car and step outside to the pavement, where quite a lot of people sat talking and just letting the breeze caress them. That was such a good decision, and till date, I think that was one of the best
          evenings I spent with my parents in Vadodara. We sat there overlooking the view of distant buildings and the river flowing far away. We bought some roasted snacks from a vendor who was selling them, and the taste of those against the cool winter wind really was something.
          <br>
          This was back when this area was still developing. Soon, word came of the installation of lights on this bridge, and this sent me on cloud 9! I remember waiting incessantly for the day to come, when we could zoom through neon lights as in some movie or a music video. Wind and lights are a good combination, I feel, and you have to experience it to really fathom the wonder.
          Well, when the much awaited day come, we set out for our little adventure. The slowly increasing anticipation as I sat with bated breath in the car, was rewarded completely when we reached the bridge. And, to this day, I cannot explain the emotions I felt at that moment. It might seem too big a reaction for such a small thing, but it meant a lot of things to me. Firstly, I was moved with joy at the wonderful display that my
          eyes had ached to see. I was elated. "The colours change too!", I said like a little child in awe of a big basket of candies. Then, in a moment, a bittersweet feeling overcame. I remembered how I would have to leave Vadodara soon. (Both due to college, as well as, because my father has a transferrable job), and how I had seen this bridge start from a very plain transit to such a futuristic one. And, this went for all my beloved 
          places in Vadodara. Even now, when I think of Vadodara (we do not live anymore), apart from my friends, the thing that I miss the most are these car rides we used to go on every week, and discovered new hidden places, or revisiting our usual coves of tranquility. 
          <br>
          Have you heard that popular song - "Sometimes you wanna go, where everybody knows your name, and they're always glad you came..."? If not, search up "Cheers Theme song". But, the lyrics should give you an idea of what it wants to convey, and that place for me is Vadodara (as of now). Even if the people I know over there leave, it will always welcome me with open arms. And it is only now, when I am away, that I truly realise how much these small wonders of that small city mean to me.
