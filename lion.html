        <h2>Lion Circle : A Lion fulfills his lifelong dream of becoming a singer</h2>
        <p>
          Ah yes, the Lion Circle. When you ask someone to show you around Vadodara, they'll take you to all kinds of attractions, like Pavagadh, Sursagar Lake, Laxmi Vilas Palace. But alas, if you pick me as your tour guide, you shall get a touch of perhaps unwanted humour, but hey, you don't have to leave your car to see this one. (Please let me be your tour guide).
          Well, this particular page is nothing like the three other ones, where I get rather deep and informative. Don't blame me, how can one be all deep about a lion singing into a mic? Yeah yeah, I am not underestimating his talent, I fully support him, and wish his dream of becoming a rockstar comes true. Which reminds me, there was even a 'Rockstar Circle' in Vadodara, quite close to my house actually.
          It was replaced by a Yoga circle. I am all for Yoga, but Rockstar was cooler.

          The Lion Circle is located in the heart of the bustling area - "Sama". During festivals, the circle is beautiful lit with golden or changing lights. It was during one of these days that I had first seen this peculiar sight, and had gasped, instinctively said - "Look, it's a lion singing karaoke!". Yeah, I was little then, but somehow I assumed that the lion was singing karaoke. Even now, I can't think otherwise.
          I guess, the child in us never really does leave.

          During my 10th grade board exams, my exam centre was near this circle, so everyday, in the morning, I used to pass by this circle, and for some reason, I always smiled when I saw this wonder. That greatly lightened the otherwise stressful anticipation of the exam.
